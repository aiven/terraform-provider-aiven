# aiven_flink_table (Resource)

The Flink Table resource allows the creation and management of Aiven Tables.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aiven_flink_table" "table" {
  project        = data.aiven_project.pr1.project
  service_name   = aiven_flink.flink.service_name
  table_name     = "<TABLE_NAME>"
  integration_id = aiven_service_integration.flink_kafka.service_id

  # valid if the service integration refers to a postgres or mysql service
  jdbc_table = "<JDBC_TABLE_NAME>"

  # valid if the service integration refers to a kafka service
  kafka_topic = aiven_kafka_topic.table_topic.topic_name

  schema_sql = <<EOF
      `+"`cpu`"+` INT,
      `+"`node`"+` INT,
      `+"`occurred_at`"+` TIMESTAMP(3) METADATA FROM 'timestamp',
      WATERMARK FOR `+"`occurred_at`"+` AS `+"`occurred_at`"+` - INTERVAL '5' SECOND
    EOF
}
```

- **project** (String) Identifies the project this resource belongs to. To set up proper dependencies please refer to this variable as a reference. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
- **schema_sql** (String) The SQL statement to create the table. This property cannot be changed, doing so forces recreation of the resource.
