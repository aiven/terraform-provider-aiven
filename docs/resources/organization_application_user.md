# aiven_organization_application_user (Resource)

Creates and manages an organization application user. [Application users](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/application-users) can be used for
programmatic access to the platform using a token created with the `aiven_organization_application_user_token` resource.

You give application users access to your organization, projects, and services using the `aiven_organization_permission` resource. You can also add application users to
groups using the `aiven_organization_user_group_member` resource.

## Example Usage
