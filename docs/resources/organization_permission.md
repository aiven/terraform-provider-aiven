# aiven_organization_permission (Resource)

Grants [roles and permissions](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/permissions)
to a principal for a resource. Permissions can be granted at the organization, organizational unit, and project level. 
Unit-level permissions aren't shown in the Aiven Console.

To assign permissions to multiple users and groups on the same combination of organization ID, resource ID and resource type, don't use multiple `aiven_organization_permission` resources. 
Instead, use multiple permission blocks as in the example usage.

**Do not use the `aiven_project_user` or `aiven_organization_group_project` resources with this resource**.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Grant access to a specific project
resource "aiven_organization_permission" "example_project_permissions" {
  organization_id = data.aiven_organization.main.id
  resource_id     = data.aiven_project.example_project.id
  resource_type   = "project"
  permissions {
    # Grant a user the operator role and 
    # permission to read service logs
    permissions = [
      "operator",
      "service:logs:read"
    ]
    principal_id   = "u123a456b7890c"
    principal_type = "user"
  }
  # Grant a group the write project integrations 
  # permission and the developer role 
  permissions {
    permissions = [
      "project:integrations:write",
      "developer"
    ]
    principal_id   = data.aiven_organization_user_group.example_group.group_id
    principal_type = "user_group"
  }
}

# Organization-level permissions
resource "aiven_organization_permission" "example_org_permissions" {
  organization_id = data.aiven_organization.main.id
  resource_id     = data.aiven_organization.main.id
  resource_type   = "organization"

  # Grant a user permission to manage application 
  # users and view all project audit logs
  permissions {
    permissions = [
      "organization:app_users:write",
      "project:audit_logs:read"
    ]
    principal_id   = "u123a456b7890c" 
    principal_type = "user"
  }

  # Grant a group permission to manage users,
  # groups, domains, and identity providers
  permissions {
    permissions = [
      "organization:users:write",
      "organization:groups:write",
      "organization:domains:write",
      "organization:idps:write"
    ]
    principal_id   = aiven_organization_user_group.example_group.group_id
    principal_type = "user_group"
  }
}
```
