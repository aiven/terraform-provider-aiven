# aiven_pg_database (Resource)

Creates and manages an [Aiven for PostgreSQL®](https://aiven.io/docs/products/postgresql) database. If this resource is missing (e.g., after a service power off), it will be removed from the state and a new create plan will be generated.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aiven_pg_database" "main" {
  project       = aiven_project.example_project.project
  service_name  = aiven_pg.example_postgres.service_name
  database_name = "example-database"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) Service database name. Maximum length: `40`. Changing this property forces recreation of the resource.
- `project` (String) Project name. Changing this property forces recreation of the resource.
- `service_name` (String) Service name. Changing this property forces recreation of the resource.

### Optional

- `lc_collate` (String) Default string sort order (`LC_COLLATE`) of the database. Maximum length: `128`. The default value is `en_US.UTF-8`. Changing this property forces recreation of the resource.
- `lc_ctype` (String) Default character classification (`LC_CTYPE`) of the database. Maximum length: `128`. The default value is `en_US.UTF-8`. Changing this property forces recreation of the resource.
- `termination_protection` (Boolean, Deprecated) Client-side deletion protection that prevents the resource from being deleted by Terraform. **Resource can still be deleted in the Aiven Console**. The default value is `false`. **Deprecated**: Instead, use [`prevent_destroy`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/resource-lifecycle#prevent-resource-deletion)
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Resource ID composed as: `project/service_name/database_name`.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `default` (String, Deprecated) Timeout for all operations. Deprecated, use operation-specific timeouts instead.
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

Import is supported using the following syntax:
