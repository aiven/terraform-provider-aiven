## Schema

### Required

- `project` (String) Project name. Changing this property forces recreation of the resource.
- `service_name` (String) The name of the MySQL® service user. Changing this property forces recreation of the resource.
- `username` (String) The name of the MySQL® service user. Maximum length: `64`. Changing this property forces recreation of the resource.

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `authentication` (String) Service specific authentication details. Currently only used for MySQL where accepted options are 'mysql_native_password' and 'caching_sha2_password', latter being default when this is not explicitly set. The possible values are `caching_sha2_password` and `mysql_native_password`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password of the service user (auto-generated if not provided). The field conflicts with `password_wo`. Value must be between `8` and `256`.
- `password_wo` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The password of the service user (write-only, not stored in state). The field is required with `password_wo_version`. The field conflicts with `password`. Value must be between `8` and `256`.
- `password_wo_version` (Number) Version number for `password_wo`. Increment this to rotate the password. The field is required with `password_wo`. Minimum value: `1`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `access_cert` (String, Sensitive) Access certificate for TLS client authentication.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `default` (String, Deprecated) Timeout for all operations. Deprecated, use operation-specific timeouts instead.
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
