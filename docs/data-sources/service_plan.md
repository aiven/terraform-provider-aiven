# aiven_service_plan (Data Source)

Gets detailed information about a specific service plan, including specifications and pricing for a cloud region.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get detailed service plan information including specifications and pricing
data "aiven_service_plan" "kafka_business_plan" {
  project      = "example-project-name"
  service_type = "kafka"
  service_plan = "business-4"
  cloud_name   = "aws-us-east-1"
}

# Output plan specifications
output "plan_specs" {
  value = {
    node_count      = data.aiven_service_plan.kafka_business_plan.node_count
    disk_space_mb   = data.aiven_service_plan.kafka_business_plan.disk_space_mb
    disk_space_cap  = data.aiven_service_plan.kafka_business_plan.disk_space_cap_mb
  }
}

# Output pricing information
output "plan_pricing" {
  value = {
    base_price_usd              = data.aiven_service_plan.kafka_business_plan.base_price_usd
    object_storage_gb_price_usd = data.aiven_service_plan.kafka_business_plan.object_storage_gb_price_usd
  }
}

# Calculate monthly cost estimate (assuming 730 hours per month)
output "estimated_monthly_cost" {
  value = tonumber(data.aiven_service_plan.kafka_business_plan.base_price_usd) * 730
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cloud_name` (String) Cloud region name.
- `project` (String) Project name.
- `service_plan` (String) Service plan name.
- `service_type` (String) Service type code.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `backup_config` (Block List) Backup configuration for this service plan. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--backup_config))
- `base_price_usd` (String) Hourly service price in this region in USD.
- `disk_space_cap_mb` (Number) Maximum amount of disk space possible for the plan in the given region.
- `disk_space_mb` (Number) Combined amount of service disk space of all service nodes in megabytes.
- `disk_space_step_mb` (Number) Disk space change step size.
- `id` (String) Resource ID, a composite of `project`, `service_type`, `service_plan` and `cloud_name` IDs.
- `max_memory_percent` (Number) Maximum amount of system memory as a percentage (0-100) the service can actually use after taking into account management overhead. This is relevant for memory bound services for which some service management operations require allocating proportional amount of memory on top the basic load.
- `node_count` (Number) Number of nodes in this service plan.
- `object_storage_gb_price_usd` (String) Hourly object storage price per GiB in this region in USD.
- `shard_count` (Number) Number of shards in this service plan.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).


<a id="nestedblock--backup_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `backup_config`

Read-Only:

- `frequent_interval_minutes` (Number) Interval of taking a frequent backup in service types supporting different backup schedules.
- `frequent_oldest_age_minutes` (Number) Maximum age of the oldest frequent backup in service types supporting different backup schedules.
- `infrequent_interval_minutes` (Number) Interval of taking an infrequent backup in service types supporting different backup schedules.
- `infrequent_oldest_age_minutes` (Number) Maximum age of the oldest infrequent backup in service types supporting different backup schedules.
- `interval` (Number) The interval, in hours, at which backups are generated. For some services, like PostgreSQL, this is the interval at which full snapshots are taken and continuous incremental backup stream is maintained in addition to that.
- `max_count` (Number) Maximum number of backups to keep. Zero when no backups are created.
- `recovery_mode` (String) Mechanism how backups can be restored. 'basic' means a backup is restored as is so that the system is restored to the state it was when the backup was generated. 'pitr' means point-in-time-recovery, which allows restoring the system to any state since the first available full snapshot. The possible values are `basic` and `pitr`.
