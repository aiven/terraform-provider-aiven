-> Services integrations are not supported for services running on hobbyist plans.

You can set up an integration between two Aiven services or an Aiven service and an external
service. For example, you can send metrics from a Kafka service to an M3DB service,
send metrics from an M3DB service to a Grafana service to show dashboards, and send logs from
any service to OpenSearch. For external integrations, you also need an
[integration endpoint](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs/resources/service_integration_endpoint).

You can also use service integrations to enable and use the [disk autoscaler](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aiven/aiven/latest/docs/guides/disk-autoscaler).

~> **Warning**
For services managed by Terraform, removing an autoscaler integration on services with `additional_disk_space` resets the service disk space to the service plan's disk size.
To retain the additional disk space set the service's `additional_disk_space` value manually. If the integration is managed by Terraform but not the service, the disk space is not reset.
