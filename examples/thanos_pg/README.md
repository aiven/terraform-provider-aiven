# Integrate Thanos Metrics with PostgreSQL and Grafana

This example shows you how you can integrate Aiven for Metrics (Thanos) with Aiven for PostgreSQL and Grafana. It creates all 3 services and sets up an integration to send service metrics from the PostgreSQL service to Thanos. These metrics are then sent to the Grafana service, letting you view them on a Grafana dashboard.

To view the dashboard, use the
[connection information in the Aiven Console](https://aiven.io/docs/products/grafana/howto/log-in).
