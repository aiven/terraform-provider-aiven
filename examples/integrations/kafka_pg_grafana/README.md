# View Kafka metrics with Grafana Metrics Dashboard

This example shows you how to create and integrate these services:

* An Aiven for Apache Kafka® service that produces the telemetry data.
* An Aiven for PostgreSQL® service where the telemetry data is stored and can be queried.
* An Aiven for Grafana® service for the telemetry data.

To view the dashboard, use the
[connection information in the Aiven Console](https://aiven.io/docs/products/grafana/howto/log-in).
