# Get started with Aiven Provider for Terraform 

Set up your organization on Aiven, and create your first project and user group.

This example creates a project and user group in your organization, and gives the group access to the project. You can add users who are already part of your organization. Users can be added in the Aiven Console either manually by [sending them an invite](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/manage-org-users), or you can [create managed users](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/managed-users) by verifying a domain and setting up an identity provider.

When you add groups to projects, you can give them the `admin` `developer`, `operator`, or `read_only` [project role](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/reference/project-member-privileges).

## Prerequisites

* [Install Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
* [Sign up for Aiven](https://console.aiven.io/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=devportal&utm_content=repo)
* [Create a token](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token.html)
* Add users to your organization by [inviting them](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/manage-org-users) or by [creating managed users](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/managed-users)

## Create your first Aiven resources

1. Ensure that you have Terraform v0.13.0 or higher installed. To check the version, run:  

```sh
$ terraform --version 
```

The output is similar to the following:

```sh
Terraform v1.6.2
+ provider registry.terraform.io/aiven/aiven v4.9.2
```

2. Clone this repository.

3. Replace the `ORGANIZATION_NAME` placeholders in the `get-started.tf` file. It's recommended to use your organization name as a prefix for the project name because project names must be globally unique.

4. In the `aiven_organization_user_group_member` resource, replace `EMAIL_ADDRESS` with the email of one of your organization users.

5. Initialize Terraform:

```sh
$ terraform init
```

The output is similar to the following:

```sh

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding aiven/aiven versions matching ">= 4.0.0, < 5.0.0"...
- Installing aiven/aiven v4.9.2...
- Installed aiven/aiven v4.9.2
...
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
...
```

5. To create an execution plan and preview the changes that will be made, run:

```sh
$ terraform plan

```

6. To deploy your changes, run:

```sh
$ terraform apply 
```

The output will be similar to the following:
```sh

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aiven_organization_group_project.group-proj will be created
  + resource "aiven_organization_group_project" "group-proj" {
...
Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

7. Enter yes to confirm. The output will be similar to the following:

```sh
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aiven_project.example-project: Creating...
...
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

## Verify the changes in the Aiven Console 

To view your project and user group in the [Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/):

1. In the organization, click **Projects** and select your project.

2. Click **Members** to see the user group you added to this project.


To see the user group details:

1. Click **Admin**. 

2. Click **Groups**. 

3. Select the user group to see more information, including the members of the group.


## Clean up

To delete the example project and user group:

1. To preview the changes first, run:

```sh
$ terraform plan -destroy 
```

The output shows what changes will be made when you run the `destroy` command.

2. To delete all resources, run:

```sh
$ terraform destroy 
```

3. Enter yes to confirm the changes:

```sh
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 4 to destroy
...

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes
```

The output will be similar to the following:

```sh
...
aiven_organization_user_group_member.group-members: Destroying...
...
Destroy complete! Resources: 4 destroyed.
```
