# Fork an Aiven for PostgreSQLÂ®

Forking is useful for creating a copy of a service for development, testing, troubleshooting, or migration purposes without affecting the original service.

This example creates a PostgreSQL service and a fork of that service in a different cloud and region. You can learn more about forking services 
[in the Aiven documentation](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/service-forking).
